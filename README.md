# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Project

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with 'X' or 'O'. The goal is to create a winning sequence of three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

A C++ implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe generally includes:

Grid Representation: A 3x3 array to store player moves.

User Input Handling: Players take turns entering row and column positions to mark their move.

Win Condition Checks: Functions to detect three consecutive marks in rows, columns, or diagonals.

Game Loop: A loop to manage turns, validate moves, and determine the game outcome.

Display Function: A function to print the grid and show the game's progress.
